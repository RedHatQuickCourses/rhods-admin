IMPORTANT: It may take a while to start all the service pods hence the login window may not be accessible immediately. If you are getting an error, check the status of the pods in the project *redhat-ods-applications*.
Navigate to *Workloads* -> *pods* and select project *redhat-ods-applications*. All pods must be running and be ready. If they are not, wait until they become running and ready.
