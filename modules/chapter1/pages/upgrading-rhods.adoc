= Upgrading Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI

Red Hat OpenShift AI upgrades are handled by the *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI* operator.

When an upgrade is available *OLM* creates an *Installplan* for the new version.

[subs=+quotes]
----
*$ oc get installplan -n redhat-ods-operator*
NAME            CSV                    APPROVAL   APPROVED
install-sp49w   rhods-operator.2.7.0   Manual     false   <1>
install-w6lqv   rhods-operator.2.6.0   Manual     true    <2>
----
<1> *Installplan* for the new version of the operator which has not been approved yet. It has to be approved in order to start the upgrade.
<2> *Installplan* for the currently installed version. It's been approved and the version is currently installed.


Installplan is approved either automatically when a new version is available without user's intervention or requires a manual approval. Whether the approval is automatic or manual depends on the value of the *installPlanApproval* attribute of the operator's subscription. When it is set to _Automatic_ the *installplan* is approved automatically and installation starts without user's intervention. _Manual_ value requires a manual approval.

Approvals can be set from the web console as well as from the CLI.

The following demonstration shows an upgrade with a manual approval done from the web console. 

== Demo: Upgrading Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI

WARNING: These steps are for demonstration purposes only! Do NOT run these steps in your classroom because you will continue to work with the _stable_ version of the product in the hands on labs in the course.

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure that you have installed the *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI* operator using one of the previous demonstrations (Web based or CLI). They both install a version of the operator from the _stable_ channel. The screenshots in this section were taken on an older version of the product and may not exactly match yours.

. Log in to Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift web console using a user which has _cluster-admin_ role assigned.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*, select project *redhat-ods-operator*, click on the *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI* and choose the *Subscription* tab.
Edit the *Update channel* - change it to *alpha* and click *Save*.

== Backup considerations
Permanent storage for *Jupyter notebooks* is done using OpenShift *Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)* attached to the *Jupyter notebook* pod. The operator does not manage PVCs hence there is no need to take a backup as long as the OpenShift *Namespace* where the *Jupyter notebook* pod is running is not deleted. Even in an event of accidental operator uninstallation all PVCs in namespaces created by either the operator or an OpenShift AI user remain untouched.
