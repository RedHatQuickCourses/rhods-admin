= Upgrading Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science

*Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science* operator supports _seamless upgrades_, hence upgrades are completely managed by the *OLM*

If the *installPlanApproval* parametr of the operator's subscription is set to _Automatic_, upgrades take place automatically when a new version of the operator is available without a user's intervention. If it is set to _Manual_ the upgrade must be manually approved. 
The upgrade can be approved from the web console as well as from the CLI.
For more details about manual upgare approval from the CLI se the xref:section3.adoc#manual_approval[Approving Installation Manualy] section.
