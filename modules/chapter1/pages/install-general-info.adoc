[IMPORTANT]
*Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Science* operator is available in two different main versions at the moment - *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Science Operator V1* and *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Science operator V2*. There are some differences in installation between the two. Mainly that the V1 operator installs all the *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Science* components automatically whereas the V2 operator requires you to make a selection of the components to be installed and managed by the operator after the installation. In the class we focus on the V2 operator as it will become the stable version soon. At the moment it is available through the _alpha_ and _embedded_ channels.
