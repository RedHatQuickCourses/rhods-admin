= Installation Dependencies Using the Web Console

As described in the xref::install-general-info.adoc[General Information about Installation] section you may need to install other operators depending on the components and features of Openshift Data Science you want to use.  This section will discuss installing and configuring those components.

It is generally recommended to install any dependent operators prior to installing the *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science* operator.

The *Node Feature Discovery Operator* is a prerequisite for the *NVIDIA GPU Operator*.

== Installation of Data Science Pipelines Dependencies

The Data Science Pipelines component utilizes *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Pipelines* as an execution engine for all pipeline runs, and is required to be installed to take advantage of the Data Science Pipelines component.

The following section discusses installing the *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Pipelines* operator.

=== Demo: Installation of the *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Pipelines* operator

1. Login to Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift using a user which has the _cluster-admin_ role assigned.

2. Navigate to **Operators** -> **OperatorHub** and search for *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Pipelines*

*Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Pipelines* is now successfully installed.

== Installation of GPU Dependencies

*Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science* makes it easy to expose GPUs to end users to help accelerate training and serving machine learning models.

Currently, *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science* supports accelerated compute with NVIDIA GPUs using the *NVIDIA GPU Operator* which relies on the *Node Feature Discovery* operator as a dependency.

The following section will discuss the installation and a basic configuration of both *NVIDIA GPU Operator* and the *Node Feature Discovery* operator.

TIP: To view the list of GPU models supported by the *NVIDIA GPU Operator* refer to the https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/platform-support.html#supported-nvidia-gpus-and-systems[Supported NVIDIA GPUs and Systems] docs.

=== Demo: Installation of the *Node Feature Discovery* operator

1. Login to Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift using a user which has the _cluster-admin_ role assigned.

2. Navigate to **Operators** -> **OperatorHub** and search for *Node Feature Discovery*
+

3. Two options for the *Node Feature Discovery* operator will be available.  Click on the one with *Red Hat* in the top right hand corner and in the pop up window click on **Install** to open the operator's installation view.
+
IMPORTANT: Make sure you select *Node Feature Discovery* from *Red{nbsp}Hat* not the *Community* version.
+

*Node Feature Discovery* is now successfully installed and configured.

=== Demo: Installation of the *NVIDIA GPU Operator*

1. Login to Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift using a user which has the _cluster-admin_ role assigned.

2. Navigate to **Operators** -> **OperatorHub** and search for *NVIDIA GPU Operator*
+
