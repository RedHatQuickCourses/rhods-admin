= Uninstalling Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI

The *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI* operator manages *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI* components, hence uninstalling components requires uninstalling the *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI* operator and cleaning some of the resources that have been created by the operator or users.

WARNING: These steps are for demonstration purposes only! Do NOT run these steps in your classroom because you will continue to work with the installed version of the product in the hands on labs in the course.

[IMPORTANT]
Make sure that you have installed the *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI* operator using one of the previous demonstrations (Web based or CLI). They both install a version of the operator from the _stable_ channel. The screenshots in this section were taken on an older version of the product and may not exactly match yours.

. Delete the DataScienceCluster object. 
+
Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* -> *Red Hat OpenShift AI* -> *DataScienceCluster* and delete all the *DSC* resources.
