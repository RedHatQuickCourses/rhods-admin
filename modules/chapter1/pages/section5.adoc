= Uninstalling Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science
Uninstalling of the *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science* requires unsintalling the operator and cleaning some of the resources that have been created by the operator or users.

IMPORTANT: Before uninstalling the *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Science* note all the Datascience projects that have been created. They must be deleted manually. All *Data Science* project resources are created in an *Openshift* namespace with the same name as the *Data Science* project. When an *Openshift* namespace is deleted all resources within it are deleted as well. They can be deleted prior uninstalling the operator from *Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Data Science* dashboard or manually any time later.

. Log in to Red{nbsp} Openshift web console using a user which has the _cluster-admin_ role assigned.
