= Installation using the Web Console

As mentioned earlier,  *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science* is available as an operator via Openshift Market Place. In the following demonstration you will install the *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science operator V2* using the Openshift web console.


== Demo: Installation of the Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science operator

IMPORTANT: The installation requires a user with the _cluster-admin_ role

1. Login to the Red Hat Openshift using a user which has the _cluster-admin_ role assigned.

2. Navigate to **Operators** -> **OperatorHub** and seach for *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science*.

3. Click on the Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science operator and in the pop up window click on **Install** to open the operator's installation view.
+
IMPORTANT: Make sure you select *Openshift Data Science* from *Red{nbsp}Hat* not the *Community* version.

6. In the *Create DataScienceCluster* view choose a name for your cluster and select components that will be installed and managed by the operator. For this demonstration you can accept the default selection of components.
+
You can choose to create the DataScienceCluster using either the _Form view_ or the _YAML View_. The _Form view_ is a web based form and 'YAML view' is based on a YAML definition of the DataScience cluster resource. The following picture shows the _Form view_.

If you choose the _YAML view_, you are presented with a template of the YAML DataScienceCluster resource definition similar to the one below.

<1> Name of the cluster 
<2> For components you *do not* want to install use *Remove*
<3> For components you *want* to install and manage by the operator use *Managed*
+
After naming the cluster and choosing the components you wish the operator to install and manage click on the *Create* button.

7. After creating the DataScienceCluster a view showing the DataScienceCluster details opens. Wait until the status of the cluster reads *Phase: Ready*

8. The operator should be installed and configured now. 
In the applications window in the right upper corner of the screen the *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Data Science* dashboard should be available.

IMPORTANT: It may take a while to start all the service pods hence the login window may not be accessible immediately. If you are getting an error, check the status of the pods in the project *redhat-ods-applications*.
Navigate to *Workloads* -> *pods* and select project *redhat-ods-applications*. All pods must be running and be ready. If they are not, wait until they become running and ready.

== Installation of other operators required by Openshift Data Science


You may need to install other operators depending on the components and features of Openshift Data Science you want to use:

* Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Pipelines operator
* NVIDIA GPU Operator
* Node Feature Discovery Operator

The following demo shows installation of the *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Pipelines* operator. Installation of the two other operators is very similar.

=== Demo: Installation of the *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Pipelines* operator

1. Login to Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift using a user which has the _cluster-admin_ role assigned.
2. Navigate to **Operators** -> **OperatorHub** and seach for *Red{nbsp}Hat Openshift Pipelines*
