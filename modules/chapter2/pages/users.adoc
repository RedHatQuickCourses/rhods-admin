= Users, Projects, and Permissions

As discussed in the previous section, Red Hat OpenShift AI allows users to install several different components to enable ML workloads.  One of the components is the OpenShift AI Dashboard, which acts as the primary user interface to help guide users to working with, deploying, and managing ML solutions.

This section discusses of the intricacies of managing users with OpenShift AI and how to modify the default permissions for a project.

== Logging Into The OpenShift AI Dashboard

OpenShift AI utilizes OpenShift OAuth as the authentication method for all OpenShift AI related resources.  When attempting to log into the OpenShift AI Dashboard or other UI components, users will be presented with a page prompting them to `Log in with OpenShift`.

image::login-with-openshift.png[]

By default, any user with the ability to login to OpenShift will be able to access the OpenShift AI Dashboard.

[TIP]
====

For assistance with configuring user access to OpenShift with various identity providers, please refer to the official https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.html[Preparing for users] OpenShift documentation.

====

== Admin Access

By default, users with the `cluster-admin` role are automatically granted admin permissions in the OpenShift AI Dashboard.  Additionally, a group called `rhods-admins` is automatically created, and any user added to that group will be granted admin permissions.

Admin access in the OpenShift AI Dashboard allows users to control various settings of OpenShift AI through the Dashboard UI, including:

- Configuring custom notebook images
- Configuring custom serving runtimes
- Configuring the idle notebook culler (automatic removal of inactive notebooks)
- Other notebook configuration settings

To add users to the `rhods-admins` group, run the following command:

```sh
oc adm groups add-users rhods-admins my-user1 my-user2
```

== Updating Default User Permissions

The default permissions for the OpenShift AI Dashboard can be updated through the menu:Settings[User management] section.

image::user-management.png[]

The admin group can be updated to another group other than the default `rhods-admins` group, such as one that is configured to sync with an external system.  Additionally, admin permissions to the Dashboard are always granted to users assigned the `cluster-admin` ClusterRole.

[TIP]
====

It is highly recommended that dedicated admin users are configured for OpenShift AI and that organizations do not rely on the `cluster-admin` role for exclusive permissions to admin configurations of OpenShift AI.  Dedicated Admin users should be added to the existing `rhods-admins` group, or another group which already contains the correct users that should be configured in lieu of the `rhods-admins` group.

====

The normal Data Science user group can also be updated to change what users are able to sign into the OpenShift AI Dashboard.  By default, the Dashboard is configured to allow all authenticated users with the `system:authenticated` role.  A custom group can be configured to allow only specific users belonging to that group to access the Dashboard.

[WARNING]
====

Updating the access in the `User and group settings` in the Dashboard will only impact a user's abilities to access the Dashboard, and will not impact any permissions granted by regular Kubernetes based RBAC.

For example, if the normal user group is updated to only allow specific users to access the Dashboard, and a user that is not part of that group as admin may still have the ability to create Data Science related objects such as Notebooks, Data Science Pipelines, or Model Servers in a namespace they have permission in using the associated k8s objects without the UI.

====
// Revised sentence suggestion - For example, the normal user group is updated to allow access to the Dashboard only for specific users. In this scenario, an administrator, even if not included in that group, might still have the ability to create Data Science-related objects—like Notebooks, Data Science Pipelines, or Model Servers—in a namespace where they have permissions, in using the associated k8s objects without the UI."

=== Managing Dashboard Permissions with GitOps

The `User and group settings` in the OpenShift AI Dashboard can also be managed using the `OdhDashboardConfigs` object called `odh-dashboard-config` located in the redhat-ods-applications namespace along with many of the other settings found in the Dashboard's Settings section:

```sh
oc get odhdashboardconfigs odh-dashboard-config -n redhat-ods-applications -o yaml
```

A truncated version of the OdhDashboardConfig object with the groupConfig settings can be found below:

```yaml
apiVersion: opendatahub.io/v1alpha
kind: OdhDashboardConfig
metadata:
  name: odh-dashboard-config
  namespace: redhat-ods-applications
spec:
  groupsConfig:
    adminGroups: rhods-admins
    allowedGroups: 'system:authenticated'
```

This object can be exported from the cluster and stored in a git repository to enable managing these settings with GitOps.

== Default Data Science Project Permissions

The OpenShift AI Dashboard permits users of the Dashboard to create new Data Science Projects when self-provisioning is enabled on the cluster:

[NOTE]
====

The terms `Namespaces`, OpenShift `Projects`, and `Data Science Projects` are often used synonymously.  While there are technical differences between these objects, a project is essentially a namespace with some additional features provided by OpenShift.  OpenShift will always create a corresponding project for every namespace, and vice versa.  

Similarly, a Data Science Project is just an OpenShift Project that has a specific label, which enables it to be used with the Dashboard.

====

[TIP]
====

For information on how to disable self-provisioner on OpenShift refer to the official https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/projects/configuring-project-creation.html#disabling-project-self-provisioning_configuring-project-creation[Disabling project self-provisioning] OpenShift documentation.

====

When a user creates a new Data Science Project through the Dashboard, the Dashboard will create a corresponding OpenShift Project and Kubernetes Namespace.  The user who created the Data Science Project will automatically be granted the OpenShift admin role for the Namespace.

[NOTE]
====

OpenShift allows for both "cluster admins" who have the ability to manage all cluster and namespace scoped objects on a cluster, and "namespace admins" that have permission to manage all namespace scoped objects in a specific namespace.

All users with the `cluster-admin` role have the ability to see all other users namespaces.

====

=== Managing Permissions on a Data Science Project

A Data Science Project is nothing more than a normal OpenShift Project with a few special labels.  These labels are required for the project to appear in the Dashboard.  As such, permissions to the project function the same as any other project/namespace in OpenShift.

Users and Groups permissions to a project are managed using Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC).  The Dashboard provides a user interface to easily assign additional users or groups permissions to a project.

An admin user on the project can add additional users or groups to a project by navigating to a specific project under the Data Science Projects menu, and selecting the Permissions tab.

image::datascience-project-permissions.png[]

From the permissions tab, project admin users are able to add additional users or groups and grant them the `edit` or `admin` role on the project.

[NOTE]
====

The Dashboard Permissions user interface only displays users and groups that were granted permissions directly through the Dashboard.  Any users or groups that have been granted permission to the Project by any traditional OpenShift role management such as creating RoleBindings on the project or who are granted higher level cluster permissions will not be displayed in the user interface.

====

=== Manually Creating Data Science Projects

When self-provisioner is disabled on a cluster, a cluster administrator will be required to manually create Data Science Projects for users.

As mentioned previously, a Data Science Project is a normal OpenShift project/namespace with a few special labels that allow to be managed by the RHOAI Dashboard, allowing it to be managed using any existing processes or tools your organization already utilizes to manage namespaces.

To manually create a Data Science Project from the cli, you can run the following commands to create a namespace and apply the necessary labels:

```sh
oc create namespace myproject
oc label namespace myproject opendatahub.io/dashboard='true' modelmesh-enabled='true' 
```

Alternatively, the following YAML object can be used to create the Data Science Project:

```yaml
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myproject
  labels:
    modelmesh-enabled: 'true'
    opendatahub.io/dashboard: 'true'
```

Once the Data Science Project has been created, access to the project will need to be configured for the necessary user or group using either the cli, or a namespace RoleBinding.  Refer to the OpenShift documentation for https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/using-rbac.html#adding-roles_using-rbac[Adding roles to users] for additional instructions.

== Exercise

Create a new Data Science Project and add a group with `edit` permissions.

1. Create a Data Science Project called `group-demo`.
2. Navigate to the OpenShift Web Console, and create a Group called `my-team`.
3. Add user1 and user2 to the Group `my-team`.
4. Back in the OpenShift AI Dashboard, grant the team `my-team` the `edit` role on the project `group-demo`.
