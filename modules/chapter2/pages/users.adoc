= User Types and Permissions

== Logging Into RHODS

RHODS utilizes OpenShift OAuth as the authentication method for all RHODS related resources.  When attempting to log into the RHODS Dashboard or other UI components, users will be presented with a page prompting them to `Log in with OpenShift`.

By default, any user with the ability to login to OpenShift will be able to access the RHODS Dashboard.

For assistance with configuring user access to OpenShift with various identity providers, please refer to the official [Preparing for users](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/post_installation_configuration/preparing-for-users.html) OpenShift documentation.

== Admin Access

== Updating Default User Permissions

== Notes
* Brief coverage of how default RHODS authentication uses the underlying OCP OAuth
* Cover how to create “special” RHODS users and groups
* [Trevor] We should be recommending configuring users in the default RHODS admin group instead of relying on the cluster-admin role.
* Implications of users and groups on DS projects, workbenches, data connections, storage
* How to manage different groups of teams working in a large organization - some work needs to be shared, some needs to be isolated from others
* [Trevor] Might be worth at least touching on how group sync works a bit in OCP.  Probably a much deeper topic than we want to go in this training, but large organizations should be using group sync and managing those groups outside of the cluster.
* [Trevor] We need to cover how an admin can create data science projects for users when Self Provisioning is disabled on the cluster.
