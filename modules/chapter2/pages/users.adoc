= User Types and Permissions

== Notes
* Brief coverage of how default RHODS authentication uses the underlying OCP OAuth
* Cover how to create “special” RHODS users and groups
* [Trevor] We should be recommending configuring users in the default RHODS admin group instead of relying on the cluster-admin role.
* Implications of users and groups on DS projects, workbenches, data connections, storage
* How to manage different groups of teams working in a large organization - some work needs to be shared, some needs to be isolated from others
* [Trevor] Might be worth at least touching on how group sync works a bit in OCP.  Probably a much deeper topic than we want to go in this training, but large organizations should be using group sync and managing those groups outside of the cluster.
* [Trevor] We need to cover how an admin can create data science projects for users when Self Provisioning is disabled on the cluster.
