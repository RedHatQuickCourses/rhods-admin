= Importing Custom Notebook Images

In this section we will go over importing a custom notebook through the RHODS dashboard and test it to make sure our dependencies are included.

== Import the Notebook Image
Before we import the image into RHODS we need to set the quay repository we just created to public. In a browser login to quay.io and go to the rhods-admin-custom-image repository. Select the *Settings* gear icon.

Scroll down until you see the *Repository Visibility* section.  Click the *Make Public* button and click Ok to make the repository public.

Login to the RHODS dashboard as the admin user. Expand *Settings*, click *Notebook Images*, and then click *Import Image*.

== Test the Image in a Workbench

Now we'll test out the image we just imported. Go to *Data Science Projects* and then click the *Create data science project* button.

Login to the notebook and click the *Python 3.11* notebook tile.

In the first cell of the notebook add the following
[source, python]
----
pip list | grep "^s"
----
Prest Shift + Enter on your keyboard to execute the cell. This will find all of the dependencies that start with "s". Note that seaborn is an installed dependency.

Now let's test out the seaborn package to make sure it works. Copy the follwoing code to the cell below.

[source, python]
----
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Load the dowjones dataset
dowjones = sns.load_dataset("dowjones")

# Create a line plot with the year on the x-axis
sns.lineplot(
    x="Date",
    y="Price",
    data=dowjones,
)

# Set the title and labels
plt.title("Dow Jones Industrial Average by Year - 1914 to 1968")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Price")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
----
