= Importing Custom Notebook Images

In this section we will go over importing a custom notebook through the OpenShift AI dashboard and test it to make sure our dependencies are included.

== Import the Notebook Image
1. Before we import the image into OpenShif AI we need to set the quay repository we just created to public. In a browser login to quay.io and go to the rhods-admin-custom-image repository. Select the *Settings* gear icon.

2. Scroll down until you see the *Repository Visibility* section.  Click the *Make Public* button and click Ok to make the repository public.

[TIP]
====
To use private container images, you can create a `dockerconfigjson` secret in the `redhat-ods-applications` project and assign this secret to the `default` service account in this project.

The secret can contain the registry credentials in dockerconfig JSON format, which, if you use Quay, you can download from the btn:[Account Settings] page, by clicking btn:[Generate Encrypted Password] and then downloading the credentials JSON file from the btn:[Docker Configuration] option.

After downloading the credentials file, use this file to create a secret:

[source,console,subs=+quotes]
----
$ oc create secret generic quay-pull-secret \
 --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=_path-to-credentials-file.json_ \
 --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson \
 -n redhat-ods-applications
----

Finally, link the secret to the `default` service account as a pull secret:

[source,console,subs=+quotes]
----
$ oc secrets link default quay-pull-secret --for=pull \
 -n redhat-ods-applications
----

3. Login to the OpenShift AI dashboard as the admin user. Expand *Settings*, click *Notebook Images*, and then click *Import Image*.

+
You should now see the image in the list and enabled.

== Test the Image in a Workbench

1. Now we'll test out the image we just imported. Go to *Data Science Projects* and then click the *Create data science project* button.

2. Give the project a name and resource name. Click the *Create* button.

4. Give the workbench a name and select the rhods-admin-custom-image from the Image selection drop down list. Click the *Create Workbench* button.

5. Once the Status changes to Running click the *Open* link.

6. Login to the notebook and click the *Python 3.9.16* notebook tile.
+

7. In the first cell of the notebook add the following
+
[source, python]
----
pip list | grep "^s"
----
Press Shift + Enter on your keyboard to execute the cell. This will find all of the dependencies that start with "s". Note that seaborn is an installed dependency.
+

8. Now let's test out the seaborn package to make sure it works. Copy the following code to the cell below.
+
[source, python]
----
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Load the dowjones dataset
dowjones = sns.load_dataset("dowjones")

# Create a line plot with the year on the x-axis
sns.lineplot(
    x="Date",
    y="Price",
    data=dowjones,
)

# Set the title and labels
plt.title("Dow Jones Industrial Average by Year - 1914 to 1968")
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("Price")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
----

Click Shift + Enter to execute the cell. You should see the graph below. You can now close the notebook. Don't worry about saving it.

Congratulations! You've succesfully built, imported, and tested a custom image in OpenShift AI.
